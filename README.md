--Haskell Projectile Motion Simulation--

Required packages : base, gloss
(Use cabal install to download the gloss package from hackage.)

First attempt at a physics simulation using functionally programmed animation. Run the program by
loading the file 'Main.hs' in GHCi and calling the function 'main'. Change the parameters like initial
velocity, gravitational field constant, size of the ball, and scale in the file 'Main.hs'.
